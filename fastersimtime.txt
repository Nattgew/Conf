Faster Sim Time

This is a Python plugin that uses Sandy Barbour's Python Interface.
 
Tested on 64-bit Arch Linux running X-Plane 10.36, Python Interface 2.73.06.
 
This plugin will toggle the sim speed between 32x and 1x. This is the same sim speed that Ctrl+T toggles up to 6x (which is separate from ground speed). It is subject to the same limitations, so it will only run as fast as the hardware allows.
 
When set to 32x, a small window will be displayed to show the actual speed that the sim is achieving.

The idea of this plugin is to allow the sim to run as fast as possible. Depending on your settings, you may not get any benefit in typical situations over land. This plugin provides the most benefit in clear skies over water.
 
To Do:
Make it easier to change what speed is used.
 
Notes:
To change the max speed, just change the "self.MAX_SPEED=32" line towards the top to the value you want. Reload the plugins or restart X-Plane to make it take effect.
