Had a frustrating experience finding the right airport over the weekend, though I'd share in case anyone else runs across it or knows how to fix it.

I was trying to fly into Miraflores (SKMF). I dialed SKMF into the default FMS, and flew there. But then things got weird.

Even though my GPS coordinates matched the coordinates for SKMF listed on the FSE airport page, FSE was convinced that I was at SP0B. I was SE of SKAC on Skyvector, and NE of where SP0B is on FSE (SPEE on Skyvector). FSE shows SKMF where it is on Skyvector. I ended up getting distance and bearing information for SKMF to the two nearest VOR stations and using those to fly to the right area in X-Plane, and landed in a clear area.

I'm not 100% sure I had the latest version of the FSE airports for X-Plane, but I searched the latest version of the apt.dat and didn't find SKMF.
