This is a Python plugin that uses Sandy Barbour's Python Interface.
 
Tested on X-Plane 10.31.
 
This is a simple auto throttle plugin, for airplanes that don't have one. It uses a simple PID feedback controller to adjust throttle to maintain a set speed. It uses X-Plane's built-in autopilot speed setting. Since planes without auto throttle don't generally show the autopilot speed setting, you can use a plugin like the "Dial Magnifier", which will display the setting each time it changes.

The plugin will add three custom commands. One will toggle whether this plugin actively controls throttle. The other two will add or subtract one knot from the speed setting.

The plugin is currently tuned and coded for the PC-12. It also has settings for the B1900D and Challenger 300. These are mainly to respect an upper limit on throttle, but could also be independently tuned as well.

There is a function that can be enabled to display information like error and PID values to help with testing.
 
To Do:
More tuning and per-airplane code. Any airplane should work, but would need to have code added for upper throttle limit, and possibly gain tuning.
 
Notes:
Feel free to modify the code if you wish. If you want to share ideas, modifications, or settings for specific aircraft, they might be added to the plugin.
