With the new 10.31 upate, using the "start with engines running" option in X-Plane, the electric bus tie is always closed (connected). Connecting the APU generator, and then disconnecting it, opens the bus tie. The bus tie will close again if the engine switches are moved from "run" to "off", or if ground power is applied, and you have to cycle the APU switch again to open the tie.



Performance

I notice that fuel burn and flight performance were mentioned as being changed in the recent update. I noticed some changes in my initial flights.

Previously the plane generally had an L/D of 14 or 15. Now it maxes out around 12 in cruise, and is 10 or lower at lower altitudes. This means more thrust (and fuel burn) required to hold a speed, slower climb speeds, and harder to maintain cruise speed.

Which leads me to fuel burn. Previously I was getting about 300 gph from takeoff to landing. Things online seem to suggest 270 gph or lower. With the update (and lower L/D), it now burns even more fuel. I used to be able to get under 800 lb/h in each engine during cruise easily. Now, even at light load and high altitude, it's oven 800 lb/h per engine.

I generally climb at 250 kias to 10,000 feet, then 270 kias to M0.76, and then cruise at M0.80.
