Altimeter Helper

Currently only available for 64-bit Linux, tested on 64-bit Arch Linux running X-Plane 10.25, no guarantees it will work at all for anyone ever.

This plugin will display a small overlay window (for 2 seconds) every time the altimeter setting is changed. This is helpful for cases where the setting is hard to read, or when outside the cockpit.

The altimeter can also be automatically set with Ctrl+Shift+B, which will use either 29.92 (if above 18,000 feet) or the current local altimeter (if below 18,000 feet).

The plugin will also automatically switch the altimeter when passing through 18,000 feet. I have tried to prevent it from switching back and forth when level at 18,000 feet.

To Do:
I may attempt to compile for Windows or Mac if there is interest, but would not be able to test it myself. Feel free to make/modify your own from the source.
Currently the settings (transition altitude 18000 feet, box shows for 2 seconds, key combo, etc.) are hard coded. I may attempt support for a settings file/window in the future.

Notes:
This plugin will not show up in the menu, because I'm lazy and there would be nothing to see. You should know if it's working just by changing the altimeter setting.
Setting the altimeter with Ctrl+Shift+B (or descending through 18,000 feet) uses the pressure setting from your current position. Depending on conditions, it may be different further along your course.
The source code for this plugin is included in the download.
While I enjoy programming from time to time I am no expert, especially with C. I welcome any suggestions.

About:
This is my second X-Plane plugin (the first is an XACARS client, much more complex and not ready to publish yet). The "Visual Altimeter" plugin available here supports Windows, Mac, and Linux, but is unfortunately only 32-bit at this time. Since it has not been updated since 2007, I did not have much hope for an update anytime soon, and decided to write my own.

The source code for a landing speed plugin was very helpful, and I used it as a basis for the display functions.
