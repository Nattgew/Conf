09/05/2014 - Updated the code to add some functionality. I did not update the C version, so it is not included. If there are any 64-bit Linux users out there that don't want to use the Python version, let me know and I may try to keep the C version up to date.

The old hard-coded "hot key" of Shift+Ctrl+B has been replaced with a custom command. You can now go to the "Joysticks and Controls" settings to create your own key combination for this feature. You can view the extra commands from the upper right of that window.

The plugin will now alert you if your altimeter setting causes your indicated altitude to be off by more than 250 feet. You can comment that part out of you don't want this.

The popup now shows the change in altimeter setting versus the previous setting. This is helpful to see how much of a change there was when descending through the transition altitude or using the key combination to set the altimeter.

* Removed the "hot key" and replaced with a custom command
* Moved the popup down slightly to not interfere with the Dial Magnifier plugin (thanks for the tip about that plugin, by the way)
* In addition to the new altimeter setting, popup also shows the net change in inHg from previous setting
* Transition altitude is now a variable so it can be easily changed as needed
* Cleaned out some unneeded things from the code
