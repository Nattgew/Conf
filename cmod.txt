This is a Python plugin that uses Sandy Barbour's Python Interface.
 
Tested on X-Plane 10.31.
 
This plugin provides various commands that can be assigned to keys/buttons. The main usefulness is for toggles that X-Plane doesn't provide, or commands that have different functions depending on a condition, such as what the current airplane is or whether the autopilot is engaged.

Toggles allow using one key/button instead of two or more:
*Speed brakes (armed/deployed)
*Landing gear and lights (together)
*Flaps (down through all settings, then retracted)

Conditionals change their behavior depending on the state:
*Aileron trim or heading adjust (depending on AP engaged)
*Elevator trim or vertical speed adjust (depending on AP engaged)
*Look left/right/up/down (depending on 3D or 2D cockpit)
*Front view (depending on 2D or 3D cockpit)

Simple helper commands:
*AP vertical speed +100 and -100 fpm

To Do:
Commands that can test what the current view is.
 
Notes:
The plugin assumes the plane has a 2D cockpit unless it is coded into the plugin.
Feel free to modify the code if you wish. If you want to share ideas, modifications, or settings for specific aircraft, they might be added to the plugin.
